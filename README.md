# Chatbot_Development
This repository contains an implementation of an AI-powered chatbot built using a sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM networks. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of conversations and can generate meaningful responses based on the user's input. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture
